# QRust
Generate QR codes with rust

Started off as a server-side app, [inspired from this article](https://www.kiranjohns.xyz/blog/firebase-qr/) by Kiran Johns and built with [kennytm/qrcode-rs](https://github.com/kennytm/qrcode-rust), possibly this goes on to become a rust microservice, even a client side PWA(in rust-wasm). Let's see!

### Run the backend
```rust
cargo run
```

### View the frontend
- Open `http://localhost:8080` in a browser.
